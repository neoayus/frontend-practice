# Learning Archive

This repository contains a collection of **practice projects and experiments** created while learning frontend development and working with APIs.

Instead of keeping multiple small repositories public, I’ve organized them here to keep my GitHub clean while still documenting my learning process.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

* Store learning-based and experimental projects
* Track progress while learning frontend development
* Keep practice work separate from polished, portfolio-ready projects
* Maintain a clean and focused GitHub profile

This repo acts as a **learning log**, not a showcase.

---

## What You’ll Find Here

* API practice projects
* UI clones and layout experiments
* JavaScript practice builds
* Small frontend concepts tested out

Each folder represents a different learning project.

## Note

These projects are created **for learning purposes only** and may not follow production-level best practices.
More polished and complete projects are available separately on my GitHub profile.
